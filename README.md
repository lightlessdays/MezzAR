NASA's Mars Exploration Rover mission was a robotic space mission involving two Mars rovers, Spirit and Opportunity, exploring the planet Mars. It began in 2003 with the launch of the two rovers to explore the Martian surface and geology; both landed on Mars at separate locations in January 2004.

Since leaving their landing sites, the twin rovers have sent hundreds of thousands of spectacular, high-resolution, full-color images of Martian terrain as well as detailed microscopic images of rocks and soil surfaces to Earth. Four different spectrometers have amassed unparalleled information about the chemical and mineralogical makeup of Martian rocks and soil. Special rock abrasion tools, never before sent to another planet, have enabled scientists to peer beneath the dusty and weathered surfaces of rocks to examine their interiors.

Unfortunately, all good things eventually come to an end, as Nelly Furtado famously declared. On 13 February 2019, the Opporunity Rover died. The last message it sent to Earth was "My battery is low and it is getting dark".

This project is a memory of that rover. It's an immersive experience that lets people attach parts to the mars rover, and see each part in detail. It entails the curiosity of children and adults alike. 

## Features

This is an interactive hologram of Mars Rover that allows user to assemble the rover, investigate its parts by holding them and interacting with them. It allows user to explode the rover and investigate each part closely. The hints allow users to easily assemble the rover. This project has been made possible to Microsoft MRTK2, ARFoundation and Unity.
